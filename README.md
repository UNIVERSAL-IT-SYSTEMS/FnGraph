# FnGraph

A simple LOVE-based graphing utility.

Right now, you have to edit the code to show different graphs. When my Pop.Box
library is usable, I will have an interface for modifying and working with
functions and the display.

## ToDo

- Add a x/y grid to show what actual values are being displayed.
- Add a GUI for adjusting values for displaying the graph.
- Add a GUI for typing in functions.
- Add a save/load system for saving and loading functions.
- Make saving/loading optionally allow saving display values.
- Options for how to show the grid? Or just a toggle.
- Fullscreen / screen size toggle.

*(Pronounced "effing graph" because I think that's amusing, even though that has
nothing to do with how I came up with the name.)*
